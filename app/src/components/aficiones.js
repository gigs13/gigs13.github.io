            <p>Rock Climbing is my favorite hobby just because it is about going out and getting to feel and be with nature.</p>
            <p>I love reading as many books as I can, novels, biographies, fiction, self-help and business books.</p>
            <p>To this date and since I was a little kid I love getting my hands dirty and play witch tech. If I can create/program something with my hands I am more than pleased.</p>
